## Extra Challenges

### The Dreaded `if` Statement

Can you complete implementations of each of the creatures without using `if`
statements? Think about how removing them affects your code.

### Imagine Two Creatures

Can you add two new creatures to the repository? How about a Hydra? Add unit
tests exercising some of the following concepts:

* Initializing constructor with data
* Using methods to change the internal state of an instance
* Using methods to query the internal state of an instance
