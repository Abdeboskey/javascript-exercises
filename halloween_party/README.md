## Running Tests


To run a single test file call this command:

```bash
$ open test/bag-test.html
```

^ This will open up the file in the browser ^

To run all the tests:

```bash
$ open test.html
```

## Sequence

Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `test/candy-test.html`
* `test/bag-test.html`
* `test/costume-test.html`
* `test/trick-or-treater-test.html`

Bag and Trick or Treater are where the meat is.
