# Objects and Methods

Run a test file by calling opening it in your browser. From this folder:

```bash
$ open exercise-1/test/bag-test.html
```

All the tests can be run by opening `test.html`

```bash
$ open exercise-1/test.html
```

Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `test/candy-test.html`
* `test/bag-test.html`
* `test/costume-test.html`

Bag and Trick or Treater are where the meat is.
